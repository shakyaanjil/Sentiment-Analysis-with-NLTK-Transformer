Once you taste it, you will find that the flavor is bold yet smooth, it has a slightly dark, powerful flavor without any of the coarseness or bitterness. I went directly from one of those high-pressure coffee pod brewing systems to using the Melitta in a percolator, and it seems Melitta has helped me find my way back to a better cup of coffee."

Amicucci,2,3,5,1271376000,Best Canned Artichokes Out There!,"UPDATE - 8/9/2010<br />A lot can happen in just a couple months, the last two cases of these I have ordered from Amazon have been horrible.  I've had whole artichoke leaves in several cans (not the small soft leaves near the heart, I'm talking the big tough artichoke leaves). Brown spots over many of the artichokes.  Very poor quality.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon both times, the first time they replaced the case and the quality was much better.  The second time I asked them for a refund because two times in a couple months is not acceptable. I also contacted Reese direcly who doubted me and asked me to ""prove it"" by sending them two cans at my expense. I told them I'd gladly send them all the cans at their expense, but they would not do that. My impression of Reese has changed very much and I will no longer buy their products.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW - I've tried just about every brand out there and Reese, by far, is the best!  I love that you can buy them already quartered, great for tossing into salads.<br /><br />They are always good quality, not too firm, not too soft. Consistent taste, never a bad one in any can. Best price on Amazon too, about $1 cheaper per can then my local grocery store."

I used to buy a Greek & California brand of brined grape leaves from the grocery store; but since the store doesn't carry them, I ordered ""Roland"" brand.  These are the thinnest, most delicate grape leaves I have ever worked with.  Only 50% of the grape leaves were usable.  The rest were scraps.  Of the 50% that were usable, they were very thin, torn in places and had to be patched together sometimes.  I stuffed them with rice, etc. and never overstuff.  I think that they processed the grape leaves in brine solution for too long.  As far as my prep on them, I rinsed them and put them on warm water and gently boiled for 1 minute.  I do this all the time and have never encountered such leaves.  I knew prior to gently boiling them that the leaves were fragile because they broke apart in my hand as I was taking them out.  Don't buy this brand to stuff.  Stick with another brand.  I can't remember which brand I used to buy, but I think it had a yellow label (California) and the Greek one might have been ""Krinos""."

Making this dish usually takes hours, but with this box you can cut down that time a bit.<br /><br />You brown your meat, whether its lamb or beef, pour in the curry mixture (which I added coconut milk to instead of water like other reviewers) then cook for another 15 to 20 minutes and let it get all married together and smelling magnificent. And although this is an Indonesian dish I paired it with Jasmine rice to bring out more flavors and add another aromatic layer.

Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!"

Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo.

What can 1.62 ounces of tea really do? I expected to get about 4 or 5 teas, and not much else, despite the claim to many servings. However, this is a nice product and might be better for others.<br /><br />1. The taste reminds me too much of a hospital, maybe its just the peach flavor, but it reminded me of it (and I wasn't alone with this opinion)<br />2. You really can get a lot of servings out of it. The measure is very unscientific (they define a servings as a ""squirt"", which as you might guess varies quite a bit. A strong squirt? A quick squirt? A you-hold-for-a-second squirt? Who knows, but it falls somewhere in between. In general a strong squirt can give a bit of flavor to a 12 ounce glass of water.<br />3. Its convenient as it mixes very easy with water. If you are not picky, you don't even have to stir it. For a consistent taste, you can just stif for 2 seconds. If you want it sweeter, just keep adding squirts, (3 squirts on a 12 ounce glass makes for a very sweet tea, I wouldn't recommend more than that)<br /><br />Another positive in my book is the use of alcohol based/type sugars, as opposed to high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />However, at around $5 dollars per 1.6 ounce jar, it's quite expensive. I would say you get 20 decent size servings out of it, that comes out to 25 cents per strong squirt. Maybe the convenience is worth it.<br /><br />If it weren't for the hospital taste, I'd give it 4 stars."

When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.

I thought they were just your average dried fruit that I could cut up and put in breads and cakes, but they are certainly not that, so do not make the same mistake with them that I did.<br />Otherwise, they are pretty nice. Now, as you might guess, I am an adult. So once I realize that I had a snack item on my hands, I decided to try it out in that capacity. That is where I became disenchanted with this product to some extent. The little packages of pears are not NEARLY enough for a snack for an adult. I have to eat 3 of them to feel like I got a snacks worth, and I am not a heavy eater. A whole candy bar is too much. A whole pear is almost too much, but these little packages are just not enough. The package says it holds the equivalent of one pear. My guess is, that these are mighty small pears.<br />They are nice and sweet though. That is the biggest positive about this item. The taste is GREAT. I really do like that part.<br />One reviewer mentioned that these tend to crumble easily and they do. About an eight of the product is at the bottom of the bag in a mess of crumbs. That is a disappointing factor. Since I had expected dried fruit, I guess I also expected that these snacks had a little more body to them than they do.

The overall consensus was that these were ""OK"" but generally most didn't really care too much for these. My opinion is as follows:<br /><br />PROS: Healthier than eating some of the other cookies on the market, has a decent taste when it's present.<br /><br />CONS: The cranberry was a little too chewy at times, which was kind of a little annoying. Even worse than that is occasionally the cookies were pretty bland tasting. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if it's just me, but these just didn't have a lot of flavor. (However, the blueberry ones I also got to try had a lot of flavor, so it's possible I just got an underseasoned batch.)<br /><br />These weren't horrible, but I don't think I'll be putting my own money towards this flavor anytime soon. When the cookies had a flavor I could taste, they were pretty good. It's just that these were sort of bland tasting that makes me not really like them as much. I might give them another chance somewhere down the line, but offhand I'm going to stick to the blueberry flavor. These were just ""OK"" & that's about all I can say for them."

If you are looking for food for an older kid with eating issues/food aversions/texture issues etc... they are smooth as regular apple sauce, but the flavor made my son spit it out.  I thought they tasted good, but I'm not the one with the food aversions (or at least not the same ones)...  My son did eat plenty of green veggies as an infant that he won't touch now (even if pureed), so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Our family regularly consumes more of these baby food ""pouches"" and fruit sauce ""pouches"" than I imagine most families who have an actual baby at the suggested ""stage"".  My son has autism and has quite a few issues with eating so not only does something have to taste good, it has to be uniform in consistency, and it has to look and smell acceptable to him.  He is 8 and he will eat baby food puree (Earth's best in the little glass jars) that doesn't have any ""gummable"" chunks that older babies usually get.  Add in that we have G6PD Deficiency and follow strict dietary rules and there are few ""convenience"" foods that are suited to our needs...<br />My son adores the Revolution Foods pouches but will not touch home-made apple sauce (even if hidden in reused baby food jars)... Some of the Ella's Kitchen pouches he adores and others he hated so much that he will go through the entire fridge shelf of pouches just to make sure none of those flavors have infiltrated...<br /><br />I was hoping that this Baby Gourmet Simple Puree Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pouch would be a great way to get some Broccoli and other green goodies in his belly.  They do have some added ascorbic acid, which is contraindicated in high doses for folks with G6PD deficiency, but I calculated the potential dose and for us (your mileage may vary and you should consult your pediatrician or hematologist about ascorbic acid and any other contraindicated substances) it was ok.  My spouse joined us in the pouch taste test.<br /><br />I think they taste good- like pear-apple sauce with a hint of broccoli/greens.  It kind of reminded me of when my mom would serve us pork chops and potatoes, apple sauce, and spinach for dinner when I was a kid (sans the pork chops).... My husband thought they were just as good as any of the other ones we have tried.<br /><br />My kid took two slurps of it and ran to the toilet to spit it out.  He declared that it tastes like the apple sauce went bad.  I disagree, but as far as what purees come into our house, his opinion is very important.  I think that if I diluted one of these with two regular apple sauces it might ""dampen"" the loudness of the veggies enough for him to eat it but I'm not even sure about that.  To me the green flavors weren't that ""loud"" but they definitely made this ""not pearsauce/applesauce blend""...  Definitely not a ""sneaky chef"" sort of food for our family, but I'll probably try other flavors out as they are still an extra little boost of goodness for adults on the run."

Looking closely at the chips sent to me I saw they were manufactured in 2007 and have an expiration date of January 2011 - clearly they have already expired.  This item is not returnable so I will be throwing all of the remaining bags of chips out.  That means I will have spent almost $42 for one good 1-ounce bag of chips.  So if you are thinking of buying such an item on amazon first inquire about how old the product is that will be shipped to you - I will definitely be doing that in the future."

I got the Newman's Ginger Snaps, placed them aside, and went to the store and bought Nabisco Ginger Snaps.  I did NOT open either package.  I had my wife open the packages.  She broke the cookies into bite size, handed them to me and I did 5 separate taste tests.  Of course, I had my glass of milk to complete the full test.  She mixed them up, different  brand in different order.  It would have been a better test if I could have gotten a third brand......could not find one.  The words that I used to describe Nabisco (as it turned out) Ginger Snaps were subtle, and  chewy.  The words that I used to describe Newman's Ginger Snaps were more vibrant, more ginger taste, crunchier, and more ginger flavor.  Across the board....all 5 times.....I rated the Newman's Ginger Snaps superior to the Nabisco brand.  I cannot compare against any other brand.  Seems I like the Newman's Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I have never actually done a taste test without kinda knowing the end result.  In this case, I swear that I never opened the boxes.  I had no idea what they looked like, so I really was doing this taste test thing for real.  I like Ginger Snaps....have not bought them for years......my kids don't really like them.  But they are all in college, so I can now buy things I want to eat.  I like Ginger Snaps.......with a tall glass of milk.<br /><br />I actually like both brands, but I give the Newman's Ginger Snaps points for being more what I THINK a Ginger Snap should taste like.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

How did I like it? The coffee was strong enough to make it worthy. The vanilla taste is somewhere between smell and taste, but not enough of either to really put a mark on it.  If you put sugar in your coffee, you won't need it with this (if you like vanilla).  For a `flavored coffee', it tastes very good.  It's simply a matter of taste and choice.<br /><br />Also, if you bring in your empty bag to Starbucks, they will give you a free coffee.  Isn't that nice?"

After some experimentation, we found we were able to make a great pizza dough that suited our diets perfectly using these packages. The other plus here is that the blend actually tastes good as well. We eat pizza at least once a week on average, and this Bob's Red Mill mix is the one we always use. In fact, with a little practice and toying with added ratios, our pizzas have reached the mouthwatering stage. So, i consider this to be a great product with an equally great value.

Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the ""flavor burst"", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The ""flavor burst"" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil."

Having spent a fair bit of time in Singapore & Malaysia I have come to love the regional cuisine.  Especially Beef Redang which if you have never had it is a very tasty (muslim) dry style curry.  It is a process to make at home - lots of ingredients and slow cooking to yield a savory curry of tender beef.  When prepared correctly it is a knockout dish.  When I saw this product and the great reviews I thought it might be a good way to make a quicker version when the mood strikes.  Having said that  I cannot recommend this to anyone who has had this great dish nor anyone who would like to try it for the first time.  The kit is easy enough - stir fry beef and then add spice paste, coconut milk powder and water.  Simmer until tender and then voila beef redang.  If only - the mix gave off a faintly chemical odor which i found disturbing and off putting.  Beef Redang usually (like many dishes of the region) has a funky (good) smell from the use of fermented shrimp paste or belachan. its strong but pleasant - this in no way smelled of that.  putting aside the off smell I tried the curry and found it to be not just mild but flavorless.  Maybe this was an issue with this batch but I could no way recommend this product to anyone."

Unfortunately it is far from healthy,"Don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne (red) pepper for many ""soup lovers"" and reviewers. That includes me.<br /><br />However, this is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Red Pepper and a tremendous amount of salt. Add an egg and it tastes much better. Chop up some scallion and it further improves.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup YET I like It. This dry soup mix consists of a large packet of noodles (essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a ""spice"" packet consisting largely of salt, msg and red (cayenne) pepper.<br /><br />Add some water and you have 2 1/2 cups of soup.<br /><br />Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. Some might call this soup ""medium hot"" but for many I'd imagine they would call it ""very hot"". However, it easy to adjust the heat level - just add less of the salt/spice packet.<br /><br />But the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal. However, I'll say it again, don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper!<br /><br />This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup. Make no mistake - adding an egg really changes the character of the soup.<br /><br />At the [...] I paid - with shipping - for a case of 20 -- this soup was a good value.<br /><br />I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything ""hot"". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is most appropriate and 1 or 2 stars is more accurate for this soup without an egg?<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt!!!!! That is a stunning amount of SALT. Plus this soup has 40% of the daily allowance of SATURATED fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). With almost 500 calories, you'll be adding a few inches to your waist line if you eat it regularly. It is shame the company choose palm oil to fry its noodles in (presumably to save a few cents) and added so much salt. It makes this soup needlessly unhealthy. It is, in fact, a poster child for all that is wrong with processed foods. I have to add the ingredient list is truly frightening with a long list of chemicals - far more than is typical - even in processed foods. This is probably not a soup anyone should serve more than once a month. View this soup as equivalent to a bag of potato chips, no more or less healthy.<br /><br />Another HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these ""reviewers"" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Finally, everyone should keep in mind how hard it is to believe that any dried soup with a tiny ""flavor packet"" could ever rate 4 or 5 stars among people that have a serious love of soup. Consider too, the simple fact that very few of the soup's ingredients are even readily identifiable as a ""food"".<br /><br />My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested adding an egg. It made a world of difference<br /><br />THIS SAME SOUP IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON AMAZON. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. Generally the 30 pack, which ships for free, is the better value."

So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far, has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!"

I guess they consider sugar to be natural!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40"">Biscoff Family Pack</a> are also delicious cookies, with 25 calorie per cookie and roughly the same amount of carbohydrates and sugar per cookie as Almondina, but they are't as filling and you end up consuming more calories. May be it is not possible to make delicious cookies with any less sugar. To give you perspective and comparison, Oreo Cookies have double the sugar and carbohydrate and each serving has 160 calories; and they are not filling so you end up consuming a lot more than one serving at a time. I have't found any other delicious cookies with as low carbohydrate content as Almondina. For me, they make a very healthy snack that satiates my hunger and craving for food."

Great Human Grade Cat Food Experience","During the cat food recalls of 2007, I became aware that the dry food I always fed my cats was not a good diet. In fact - at the time - I prided myself on feeding cats @ $8.00 a month.  Luckily, this Generic was not using the Gluten that was the cause of the Recalls.  After trying various tastes, my budget and cats decided on Holistic (use to be Eagle Pack Holistic) Chicken dry and Wellness Chicken Grain Free.<br /><br />Then, we had a problem with the Wellness Canned Cat Food Recently (it was pulled from Amazon - and now my Canned Chicken food doesn't show up in a review).  I then went to the Wellpet site, and noticed mostly dry food was offered from many online retailers.  THIS told me something was afoot - and I went back to the forum which helped me with cat food research.  Unfortunately, many folks had gone back to fish as a main part of their cats food.  However, they did bring up the rotation aspect - this means never feeding the same type of cat food concurrently, and also picking up some locally first, to make sure your cats will eat the darn thing.<br /><br />Locally, Chicken was the least affected of the Wellness foods, and the store I get it from, Wellness is manufactured at ANI (code begins MW).  This means I could also get a food that was produced at Menu/Simmons.  However, Weruva was raved about in the forums, so without knowing where it was manufactured - I gave a few cans a shot (Green Eggs & Chicken was the first flavor I read - so that is what I tried).  All cats slopped that food right up with no ill effects (Siberia is a 13 yo with sensi tummy issues, and there were none with this food - even after he gulped it up).<br /><br />I then looked up Weruva on the Internet, and found out it was manufactured in Thailand.  This first gave me pause, but they do guarantee Human Grade Food, and the food in the cans look quite edible (and no, I'm not eating it - but in an emergency ;-).<br /><br />Amazon has a better deal on this food than my local retailer. So my order for the cans went in (I had read some negative reviews here about the quality of the food, but with the Amazon Guarantee - how can you go wrong?)  I am pleased to announce that the food received from Amazon looked and tasted (according to the cats), as good as that purchased locally.  So for Weruva, Amazon has my business.<br /><br />With rotation, you can circumvent the cost of Weruva in a multi-cat household, AND being on a fixed income, through rotating.  I've settled on four canned food varieties, and one dry food (I may also be inclined to try some Weruva Paw Licken' Chicken, but for now - I have plenty of food).  The cost for multi-cat households is also offset by buying the larger canned varieties - 12.5oz to 13oz, and learning how to store them in the Refrigerator.<br /><br />On Amazon, I recommend the following:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY"">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248"">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />A side note, many supplement with Friskies canned in order to cut costs.  I personally have yet to get over the meat by-product thing.  However, if it would help your budget - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6"">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is THE best one to use for this purpose (no glutens).<br /><br />3 paws up for Weruva."

It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change.

One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I ""spiced"" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?

For only 5 grams of sugar in two cookies I should have known but I at least thought that they would have some kind of flavor from the quinao and chocolate chips.  They claim to have a nutty flavor but I did not detect that at all, they tasted like a a bunch of raw flours mixed together with a few chocolate chips scattered about. At 6 bucks a box at my local health food store I feel as though I have been ripped off.  There are far better gluten free cookies out there, and you could make them better yourself as well.  I ate one and was just so let down, I really wanted to like them.  I ended up eating another one because I wanted to make sure that they really did taste terrible, and I was right.  The second cookie prooved just as bad as the first one. 140 calories in two cookies and they are a bit bigger then a silver dollar.  I have to say though that I  love how they are individually packaged and also the packaging that they are in are recyclable. If you like a dry flavorless cookie then this would be your thing.  I dont know what I will do with the rest of them, maybe wash them down with some almond milk or put them into a vegan parfait of some sort.  Or I could give them to people I dislike so they will have a horrible cookie experience.  Cookies should put a smile on your face and make your tummy happy but these just about choked me to death from how dry they were.  I would suggest that you look around your local health food store and buy one box just to give them a try but only if you have money to throw away.

The company spent a great deal of time with me explaining the below and seemed sincere.<br /><br />CHANGE FROM NEW ZEALAND TO US<br /><br />The majority of their customer base was primarily attracted to the naturally occurring 8.0 alkaline water, and had an issue with water being trucked half way around the world.  Most of the customers wanted a similar quality water with less of an environmental impact.  So the company made the business decision to follow this feedback and invested a great deal of effort finding three natural springs in the US that are naturally alkaline.  Water from New Zealand is no long available.<br /><br />The sources and the water quality report from the new US based springs can be found on their site.<br />[...]<br /><br />DISTILLED WATER<br /><br />During this time an unfortunate mishap happened regarding an order of specially requested water by a department store.  This department store requested distilled water.  The bottles were labeled differently, but the cases looked the same and unfortunately some of this water wound up being distributed by mistake.  The company states they will never create another lot of distilled water and while they regret that this water has hit the market in some areas, it is of limited supply and the issue should dissipate.<br /><br />LABELING<br /><br />The original water that was manufactured in New Zealand, says ""New Zealand"" on the label.  It is no longer being produced.  If you are lucky enough to still be in possession of this water, you have a collector's item.<br /><br />The new US based water, from the three naturally alkaline springs says Source: Multi-Spring, bottled for Eternal Beverages, Walnut Creek CA.  This is the water the company is basing its future on.<br /><br />The distilled water that is out in some markets actually says distilled water on the back of the label.  If you are in possession of this water, you have an inferior product.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL OPINION<br /><br />I happen to be in possession of the original New Zealand water, the new US based spring water, as well as several competing brands: Hawaiian Springs and Mountain Valley Springs.<br /><br />Comparing them by taste and smell, my husband and I agree that this is how we would rate the four products.  1.) New Zealand water is the clear winner, it's a shame we no longer have the option to purchase it, 2.) The US based Eternal Water is our second choice, 3.) Hawaiian Springs is a close second to the US based Eternal Water, 4.) Mountain Valley Spring Water.  Note: Mountain Valley Spring water does contain some fluoride."

First, they are very crispy (perhaps the ""snap"" in the name) but after you chew them for a while they seem to melt a bit in the mouth which somewhat unusual for such a crisp cookie. The big plus though is a spicy (relatively speaking) ginger bite to the cookies. This is what distinguishes them so much from ginger snaps I've had in the past which are fairly tasteless. These really do have a wonderful ginger taste to them. All in all, a very difficult cookie to stop eating. I went through many more than I should have before closing the bag for the evening."

I love chocolate but find that the sugar overwhelms the chocolate in most bars. Marabou is the exception. A Swede told me that Swedish law prevented their chocolate manufacturers from putting wax in the bars, which accounts in part for their high quality. IKEA used to carry Marabou but dropped it for what I consider to be a far inferior sugary German chocloate which they sell under the IKEA brand. So, the only reliable source for these bars that I have been able to identify is this web site.<br /><br />The 200g Marabou bar for $8.00 is a fair deal, but I can only find it in dark chocolate. I prefer the 250g milk chocolate bar but it seems to have mysteriously disappeared from the chocolate landscape. A few sites list it but when you try to buy the bar, they are always out of stock and do not know if it will ever be available again.<br /><br />Tip: Try melting a Marabou bar in a double boiler with cream and a little butter. Then pour the sauce over ice cream and cake. Wow!<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you love chocolate you must try Marabou before the year is out."

At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since.

128752,B004XWDPDU,A34DUYOZO7XM35,Dylan Oxford,0,0,5,1347148800,Renew my faith in Matcha,"I should mention that my first experience with matcha was not a positive one. We had bought a pouch of matcha from a tea store that shall not be named, and my fiance spent some time looking around on the internet figuring out exactly how much matcha to use for a cup of tea. Needless to say, it didn't go terribly well. I took one sip, looked at her, and said ""Are you serious, you actually want to drink this?"". Except it also involved swearing.<br /><br />I put my interest in matcha on a back burner at that point. Maybe it was something a future, more refined me would enjoy, but definitely not today.<br /><br />Then, Red Leaf Tea started showing up and making a huge effort to bring in new customers from Steepster. Reviews started popping up about their fantastic matcha, and the awesome flavors that they have. When the Belgium Chocolate Matcha went on sale, I knew it was time to give matcha another try. I figured, if I can't enjoy half-priced, chocolate flavored matcha from what appears to be the best matcha vendor around, there was probably no hope.<br /><br />For preparing this, my fiance used her battery-powered frother, as opposed to the traditional matcha tools. It may be bucking convention, but it really seems to create a nice, smooth evenly distributed cup of matcha. This resulted in a smooth, but murky jade green drink, which is significantly darker than the matcha-that-shall-not-be-named. This makes it obvious that there is true cocoa powder in here, as opposed to just a flavoring (unless there was a flavoring and a coloring, then all bets are off).<br /><br />It definitely smells very chocolatey, very sweet without any sugar added. It reminds me of a chocolate cake batter, or possibly muffin batter. There's the chocolately sweetness to it, but the hint of background... well, I suppose it's the smell of the matcha itself. Anyway, the matcha smell in the background elevates it a little bit to a baked-good smell, at least for me.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth. At first, it has a warm hot cocoa flavor to it, absolutely delicious. It is inviting, and comforting, with a subtle sweetness on your tongue (much more subtle in taste than in smell). To me, the first drink was overwhelmingly cocoa flavored, with no vegetal taste to betray the matcha lurking below. Each successive drink makes that matcha flavor come out a little bit more. There is a strangely beneficial aspect to this, and that is that the matcha flavor itself slowly builds on you. It's very crisp and clean, lightly foresty but without that swampy, seaweed taste that some green tea comes with.<br /><br />As you get to the end of the drink, there is some matcha that has settled towards the bottom. This is likely because I'm a little bit of a slow drinker, sensitive to hot liquids and such. Or, we really have no clue what we're doing. Always a possibility.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this matcha, especially if you're new to the world of matcha. It has renewed my faith in matcha as a viable beverage choice.<br /><br />You can also get this from Red Leaf Tea's website, with a staggering number of different options."

It was after all the first time ordering and I was doubtful it was going to be that good, in spite of the other reviewers who gave it very high ratings.

I traveled to Japan in 2009 and unknowingly had Matcha several times at random sushi restaurants, etc. It was interesting there but I just figured it was a normal green tea, nothing special right? Oh man, was I wrong! This stuff really is something to pay attention to, and the different flavor and health benefits possible with matcha are well beyond any standard green tea. This is really a fascinating beverage and I am excited to get back into it.<br /><br />Before this, I had never tried a flavoured matcha, in fact I had no idea such a thing could exist! Red Leaf pulls off the flavoured matcha with grace and skill, and offers a wild and impressive set of expected (vanilla bean, caramel, etc.) flavours and some wildly crazy and epic sounding ones (Coca Cola Matcha?!!!!) I am gonna have to try that one.<br /><br />I bought the Red Leaf Starter (Basic Grade), Delicate flavouring of Caramel Matcha. This is available on their site here: [...]<br /><br />Since I am a bit of a matcha newbie, I had to read their site about how to prepare it. It was very helpful. I got a whisk from Japantown and used a Chashaku (Bamboo Scoop) to measure out the matcha. I used 2 scoops and my first cup used the suggested amount, 3 oz of 80C water. I whisked it, poured it from the bowl to a mug and drank it from a mug, no extra water added. This was my previous experience with matcha in general, quite thick and vegetal. It was good.<br />In fact it was so good, I found myself going back to the kitchen to make a 2nd cup of it not 1 hr later!! This time I decided to change it up a bit, using only 1 scoop of matcha this time and a little less water, and then after whisking, adding a fair bit more water to reduce the thickness and make a larger drink. I think I actually enjoyed this better, it was a little sweeter this way and also allowed for a more tea-like experience (rather than a sort of ""tea shot"" like I had earlier). This was very tasty!<br /><br />These are the only ways I have prepared it so far but I think it might be wiser (for my unrefined palate!) to buy the ""Distinctive"" flavouring next time so that I can get a stronger flavor. This one is subtle, but I tend to enjoy stronger more bold flavourings in my tea, so I think the next one I get from Red Leaf I will pay just a little extra to get more flavouring. Excited to follow this new tasty and healthy habit!"

While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea!

It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous."

Each of the ""Bold & Creamy"" sauces are based on soybean oil, water, vinegar, buttermilk,  and a few other standard ingredients. Taco Bell Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce adds tomato to the primary recipe. Unlike the other two, this sauce has no peppers of any kind in its ingredients.<br /><br />The Spicy Ranchero Sauce has no perceptible heat, but the tang of the vinegar is much more noticeable than in the other varieties, especially if you use it as  dipping sauce. As I mentioned in one of my other reviews, I don't care for creamy sauces on my tacos. I did try the Spicy Ranchero Sauce on a couple of Taco Bell tacos, but still would choose one of the traditional red sauces.<br /><br />I made a sort of salad with celery, carrots, BBQ chicken strips, and tortilla strips. I used the Spicy Ranchero Sauce as a dressing and found it a good fit for this set of ingredients that was limited to what I had on hand at the moment. I've also used it as a dip for tortilla chips and vegetables. It occurred to me that it might be good on fish or shrimp tacos. I tried it on a Filet-O-Fish instead of tartar sauce. The fish flavor completely overwhelmed the Spicy Ranchero Sauce. I also tried it in place of seafood cocktail sauce with some cooked shrimp. It did not really add anything interesting to the shrimp.<br /><br />In my kitchen, the Spicy Ranchero Sauce is more likely to find use as a dressing or dipping sauce than a taco sauce.<br /><br />One note: the ""Best if Used By"" date on the bottle I received was a little over two months after I received it. This seems kind of short to me for a bottled product that's refrigerated after opening. It may have been an older lot, but it's something to keep in mind if you're thinking of ordering in bulk or taking advantage of a sale."

Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, ""No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors"". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential.

With this sauce, it really depends on what you add it to. Things with a lot of fat in them don't see the same ZOMG HOT HOT HOT as things that are low in fat. Example: 2 drops in a can of tomato soup is more than adequate whereas 10 drops in a can of firehouse chili isn't what i'd call ""too hot"". What I can say, is that the burn stays with you. My lips are still tingling 15 minutes after finishing eating my chili. This sauce is good for adding heat, but make sure you do so incrementally, tasting along the way. Flavor is lacking in my opinion, so I normally use something milder but with more of a chili pepper flavor when cooking, then use this sauce to boost the ""burn"" factor."

It was getting so bad, that I figured I'd spend the money and try one of these sprays knowing that the reviews for pretty much all of them seem to be split.  I figured I had nothing to lose.  So I applied as per the labels instructions.  I did not have any issue with the spray damaging any of my flowers or plants and it did seem to work initially.  I had almost a week with no new damage. There was also no rain of any note that may have washed it away.  I don't think the rain since has washed it away either though, as I can see a residue on some of the leaves on some plants that were sprayed and left high up in a place where rabbits couldn't get to them.  Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived. Again I was coming home to check on my plants and finding more bitten off leaves and decapitated lilies. I stopped checking before leaving for work because it would put me in such a bad mood every time I'd see more ""victims"".<br /> I just hate spending almost $20.00 for something (I was so desperate that I paid the extra 3.99 for 1 day even though I am a prime member) that in the end did not work as it should have. I just planted replacement bulbs for the 22 of 25 lilies that were beheaded and now I am here looking for a different kind of rabbit/small animal repellent. It's difficult to choose, as again it seems many products work for some and not for others. It looks like I was just one of the unlucky ones with this product and I'll try something else and see what happens.  Good luck to you all.  I hope you have more success than I did whether you try this product or a different one."

Linnean ""Alaskan Realtor""",0,1,3,1302048000,Not as good as some of their other options,"I've tried GoPicnic brand snacks before, and found them fairly decent for a healthier option.  This one was not as good as others we've had.  My 4 year old son and I sat down to try this, and we both LOVE salmon.  We eat it canned, baked, in dips, smoked, etc.  Living in Alaska, we eat a lot of salmon.  We both took a couple of bites of this dip, and didn't finish.  It's okay in a pinch, but a little too hot (spicy) with an odd flavor that covers up the salmon.  It's also a very strange almost gel-like consistency that we didn't like, most likely from the corn starch.<br /><br />The crackers were good, although they are white flour instead of whole grain, and we very rarely eat white flour, even though they were organic.<br /><br />We don't eat a lot of soy due to the health issues, especially GMO soy which this probably is, but we did taste the edamame for this review.  They were dry without much flavor.<br /><br />The Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix was a little odd.  It tasted okay, but was an odd combination of dried banana chips, ginger peanuts, and dried cranberries.  Not our favorite fruit & nut combo.<br /><br />The chocolate was decent, although not as good as Endangered Species dark chocolate.  It was organic, which is a plus.<br /><br />The container & packaging was nice and included a fork and napkin, so you can take it with you on the run.  There's even a Sudoku puzzle on the inside of the box for some post-picnic fun :-)<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I'd rather eat this than fast food or Snackables, but this wasn't my favorite flavor combination.  Also if you are looking for organic snacks, the only organic items in this box are the crackers and the chocolate.  Also, if you are allergic to corn, there's corn starch & maltodextrin in the salmon spread.  Obviously this also contains soy, fish, wheat, and peanuts for allergy information."

Unfortunately, our experience has not been quite as positive.<br /><br />First, I was a bit disappointed at the construction.  For this price point I would have expected something other than flimsy plastic.<br /><br />Second, within a month of buying the door the retractable plastic piece started randomly going up and down.  I called their customer service department to inquire.  The rep described it as a known issue.  The solution was to disable the auto-retract safety feature.  I asked when a permanent fix was forthcoming and she told me that disabling the safety feature WAS the fix.  Baffled, I asked if she thought that was a good solution.  She told me I could return the product for a refund if I wanted to (after having cut a hole in the side of my house) in that pseudo-polite, passive-aggressive manner that makes me want to rub broken glass in my eyes.  I hope that she was simply someone who needs to be fired rather than a typical representation of the company.<br /><br />Third, as others have noted,the collar and ""fob"" are extraordinarily flimsy.  My standard poodle destroyed hers within a few weeks.  Compared to other dogs, she is very gentle so I was surprised when it just fell apart.  I was able to click it back together a few times and get it working, but this last time I saw some sort of yellow-ish corrosive looking goo inside it.  My wife called their customer service and they are sending a replacement.  Meanwhile,the poor dog is very confused.  :)<br /><br />Fourth, the fob is NOT directional.  We have fought with sensitivity settings until we are cross-eyed and whenever the dog is close to the door, it opens.<br /><br />Had we paid $50 or $75 for this product I wouldn't have even bothered with this review.

When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.

My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse.

I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again."

For a dog her age and size, she eats around 2 cups a day (1 cup for breakfast and another for dinner).  The food might appear to ""cost more"" but you feed less because there isn't a bunch of toxic filler in it to make the dog hungry.  Ever notice how junk food is yummy but it doesn't fill you up quite like a nutritious meal?  You can equate that to dog food.  Most commercial brands have their main ingredient as ""corn"" and it goes downhill from there.  Seriously...when have you seen a pack of carnivores attack a field of corn when they got hungry?  This is what dog food is supposed to be...grain free and based on a RAW diet, exactly like the way their ancestral wolves dined.  Also...because the dog is eating less quantity and digesting more of its food...you'll have less waste in the yard."

That's not a joke or exaggeration; it's a max of 10 minutes of flavor before it hits that ""I feel like I've been chewing this for 2 hours"" taste and the gum itself becomes very tough and unpleasant to chew.  Also, for the amount of total chewing time you get out of it, it seems fairly over-priced (it's about 3 times the cost per piece compared to buying regular gum at Costco, but that's probably an unfair comparison being that it's vegan, indie-food, non-aspartame, etc.).<br /><br />Bottom-line:  There are better choices out there (like Xyla, which still isn't that great...), but if you're looking for a delicious flavor of gum that you need a new piece of every 10 minutes, then this might be your brand.

It's made from what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br /><br />In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered ""unfit for human consumption"".<br /><br />In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything -- feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat).<br /><br />I have seen enough:<br /><br />This is according to the Dog Food Advisor.<br />This is just a samll part of their review that can be found on the web just Google ""review for Beneful"".<br /><br />I am no expert so I felt the need to quote someone who is.  We love our dogs and they deserve the best food available. Personally I use only raw for my dog but thought he might like a change so I tried a few different kinds.  This is not as bad as some so I will use it for training since it is hard and not to greasy and I do not feed my dog large amounts.<br /><br />My dog does seem to like it but it is not going to be part of his mealtime.  Something I noticed on the label is a reference to feeding our dogs once a day, may I caution you, I used to feed my dog once a day until I found out that, that causes bloat.  Bloat is a very painful condition that only some dogs get when they seem to eat too fast, this is also due to the one a day feeding they seem not to be able to get enough. Please feed your dog twice per day.<br /><br />I do not feel this is a very good food for your dog.  Dogs are generally not made to deal with so much grain they are carnivores and do much better on a diet almost completely meat and bones. According to Peta some of these dry foods are the remains of dead and sick animals as eluded to in the later review.  I will stick to the diet I put my boy on.  I suggest you keep looking for something better.<br /><br />I am sure some of us do not eat the best food all the time and sometimes will eat bacon and eggs and a twinkie now and again and that is fine and it will not kill us and this food, on ocassion, will not kill our dogs but please do not feed them a food like this on a regular diet.<br /><br />We have our dogs for such a short time why not feed them quality food to keep them around longer."

For years now, I've been purchasing similar products and have never had the opportunity to try one that claims to be influenced by the Himalayas.<br /><br />At $9, I have to say that this is hardly worth it. Sure, you get a full 3.5 oz chew, but it doesn't taste anything like the fresh, crisp mountain air of the mighty Himalayas, and it barely tastes like a dog from the region. Incredibly misleading name for a chew at this price.<br /><br />Despite being disappointing, the flavor is appetizing enough (more Scottish Terrier than Himalayan mountain dog), and it's a better alternative to fried chews from similar manufacturers.<br /><br />Plus, it really helps maintain healthy gums."

Also they are not a good source of vitamins and minerals although they say that too.

And Decaf, too!","*****<br /><br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits.""<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

After shelter and vet food recommendations, we had upgraded to the shelter's all-natural healthy brand but the cats much preferred the junk from the grocery store and the senior cat rejected the natural food. After reading many reviews, We tried this brand and flavor. My partner was concerned our picky senior cat would not eat it either, but all three love it. We have also tried the Weruva Middle East Feast, which all will eat, but Paw Lickin' Chicken is the favorite so far.<br /><br />We will be trying other flavors and are also trying some Best Feline Friend varieties. BFF is a bit cheaper than these Weruva standard brand foos, and while they seem to like the one we tried so far (Tuna and Bonito Be Mine), the chicken is still tops. All of these look and smell so good, I could certainly see eating this in an emergency - it is certainly as good or better than the canned chicken at the grocer.

It is worth trying.,"Everyone has their own way of enjoying their cup of coffee, whether black or with cream and sugar. In addition, coffee comes in many grinds and blends. This coffee, is certainly worth a closer look. Trung Nyugen is an anytime of day coffee. It has a blend of four beans; Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa and Catimor.<br /><br />  When you first open the can, you will immediately notice its dark texture. The texture may remind you of baking flour. This coffee has a butter oil added in the roasting process, probably to slow down oxidation which can spell the demise of even the finest coffee. In addition, Trung Nyugen coffee is a coarse ground coffee. If you have a French press coffee maker, that's great. You are ready to make a cup. If you are not ready to make a commitment to purchase one at this time, be sure to add another paper filter in your coffee maker, to allow the water to soak up the flavors during brewing.<br /><br />  This coffee seems to me as an ""anytime of day"" coffee. But as one of the other reviewers stated, this blend tastes bitter without milk. I would agree with him. If you are an expresso or black coffee drinker and are satisfied with your coffee, it may not be worth your while to try this one. Trung Nyugen is a comfort coffee with a rich explosion of four different coffee beans, each one with its unique characteristic. I prefer to prepare it with condensed milk and a small amount of artificial sweetner. If I use half and half, the results taste much like Arabica coffee, which spoils the effect I am looking for. It seems to have a higher than average caffeine content and is slightly acidic but never bitter. It is probably the most intense tasting coffee you will have because of its unique blends. Finally, this coffee has a very small amount of cocoa flavoring. It is virtually undetectable when drinking.<br /><br />  I will buy this coffee again. I am annoyed that virtually every type of coffee that I see in the grocery store is an Arabica based bean coffee. My taste buds cry out for something that is blended, with an intense flavor that will make me look forward for more.<br /><br />  By the way, this is not the only Trung Nyugen coffee. They also make Creative One, Two...up to Creative Five. Each one has its own unique characteristic. I happen to have my own favorite of the five they have for sale. Creative One is a breakfast coffee, for those who want a very high caffeine content. Creative Two has a lower caffeine content and blends Arabica with Robusta beans. If you have time, surf the internet to find a distributor who can send you these coffees to your home or business if you want to explore more of these very unique blends.<br /><br />  As for myself, this one is a very pleasant alternative to store bought coffee. It encompasses much of what I am looking for in a coffee blend; intense flavor, higher than average caffeine content and a flavor that never tastes bitter, regardless as to how it's brewed.<br /><br />  Enjoy!"

The problem with many Nylabone products is that they are plastic or rubber and their flavor is not particularly attractive to the dog.  As a result, my dog is often quick to abandon them for the furniture, my sneakers or any of the other things that we buy them these products to prevent them from chewing.  I tried giving this Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Dog Chew to my dog because 1) it is bacon flavored so I hoped my dog would like the taste and 2) it looked a little bit different from the other Nylabones.  So far my dog has spent more time working over this particular Nylabone than he has almost any other plastic or rubber chewing toy that I have given him.  I am not sure whether it is the flavor or texture that he likes.  But I am thrilled to give him something other than rawhide that he likes to chew on.  Like other Nylabone products, the DuraChew Hollow Dog Chew is extremely tough.  I believe it was designed specifically for heavy chewers.  While my dog has definitely made some dents in it, it is still in pretty good shape and I expect it to last two or three months.  Every dog is different and you never know exactly what they will like.

127714,B001BOVE54,A32684FVIGBAY7,Nicholas Holtmann,2,2,4,1322956800,Worth trying if your cat has problems with their current food.,"I've been feeding my cat this food for about 7 months without any problems.<br />I mainly tried it because she was throwing up a lot with her previous Purina cat food.<br /><br />First the pros about this cat food:<br /><br />1. Its grain free, so cats that have sensitive stomachs (which was apparently my cat) can eat it without any problems.<br /><br />2. Since it contains less filler my cat tends to eat less, so I use less cat food overall.  I saw other reviewers complain about cost, but since she eats less I buy less so it seemed to even out.  Also, since she eats less she poops less, which I felt was the second best thing about this food (outside of not throwing up).<br /><br />3.  There's no added chemicals or preservatives in the food, so if your concerned with that its a plus.  Personally, I find that's a non-issue with me.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1. Apparently this food can cause urinary crystals (a more serious problems in male then female cats), so you may want to monitor your cat at first if you change to this food. My cat didn't have this problem, but my cat is female so it is less of an issue.<br /><br />2. Like other reviewers, I found this food has a relatively strong smell when fresh.  The smell goes away as the food dries out.  In my case, my cat won't eat it when it dries out (she must enjoy the smell).  So I keep mine in an airtight food bin and only scoop out enough when she wants some.<br /><br />3. If your cat is like mine, you won't be able to use an auto-feeder with this cat food as it dries out when open to the air.  When I used an auto feeder, my cat refused to eat the food that no longer gave off the smell at the bottom of the feeder (took me a couple feedings to figure this out).  This is kind of annoying, but its better than cleaning up throw up.<br /><br />Overall, I think if your current food is causing problems than this food provides a good alternative to the major brand name foods."

I don't usually eat much in the morning and I don't like to have anything too sweet. I've tried numerous granola bars and soft fruit flavored breads and by far this is the best I have tasted. It has the right amount of sweetness and the right amount of crunch. This was perfect with my morning green tea soy latte and mixed fruit. I didn't heat it up because I don't like my bread warm. I like to eat it just the way it is. It is very convenient and I bring it to work every morning and I snack on it as well. I bought a box of it the next day after eating the sample.

I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much ""fuller"", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!"

But overall there is only 1.5 grams of fat per bar, relatively low sodium (115 mg), 8g of sugar and 2g of protein. The top corner of box says no trans fat, but I guess that would be its only health claim as the blueberry is not real blueberries, so you are not getting the anti-oxident benefit.

What you think looks and feels like egg white is realy dried tofu skin. It is the skin that develops on a batch of tofu that they skim off the top. It's dried and sold in packages. That dried curd and this broth is what makes egg drop soup. Plus a little tumeric powder for color and flavor. Go ahead and use eggs. It will always be stringy and fishy no matter how you stir it."

My only reason to give 4 stars rather than five is that the pods are a little weak. They contain about 10% less coffee than the Senseo Dark blend and it makes a difference in the cup. I normally make a two-pod cup anyway, and deal with this slight weakness by simply shutting off the brewer a little early. Another reviewer complained that the specific varieties in the blend are not stated and that therefore the taste may vary from batch to batch. I'm not an expert by a long shot, but I do drink a lot of coffee and I've been using this blend for about a year with no detectable variation.<br />Sometimes when I want the slight extra kick of the Dark blend but still want a smooth finish I will use one pod of Dark and one pod of this Colombian blend. (That's one thing I like about the pod brewers over the Keurig style: one can mix and match)."

It was very bunched up and quite small, and still is, so I'll post pictures when it looks more exciting.  It is quite green with little red-tipped hairs; from what I can gather if you want it to be as red as the picture you have to put it under grow lights.  When it came it was not dewy at all, but it had a little stock with what appears to be little seed pods, so I imagine it is a fairly mature plant if it is trying to reproduce.  I have been moving it to different windows around the house so it gets the most sun, but it went a couple days without getting any dew at all.  Today I tried putting a clear bowl over it to increase humidity, and now little drops of dew (digestive goo) are visible on some of the hairs.  This plant seems to be progressing so far, and it is 78-79 degrees F in here with a humidity of probably 40-50%.  It may or may not need a little help from a bowl for humidity, but other than that it seems just fine in a normal house on a window sill.  The plant is small, maybe as wide as a thumb is long."

Bleah.  These cookie things aren't really anything to write home...or Amazon...about.  The cookies, or 'thins', are about the size of an arrowroot biscuit, but less satisfying.  There are 3 in a serving size, packing 5 grams of fat and 140 calories.  For 5 grams of fat I either want something yummy enough to be worth it, or filling enough to make me believe I just consumed 5 grams of fat (some of which is saturated).  So this is not a snack to hold you over between meals, dieters.  I suppose the 8 grams of whole grains are attractive, but that just translates into 21 grams of carbs and only 2 grams of fiber.  So this is not really a healthy fiber treat either.  Now you might say that this isn't a health food, so I shouldn't be judging, but by calling them 'thins', Nabisco is looking to aim at the dieting market.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping for something more chewy than crunchy.  Unfortunately, the 'chewy' is the little bits of fig scattered throughout the cookie.  So little and chewy, in fact, that they get stuck in your teeth and have you uncomfortably nomming around like a dog with peanut butter on his tongue.  The fig and honey variety had a taste and consistency somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker, but a little drier.<br /><br />So I'm not a fan of these, and I probably wouldn't buy them while roaming around the grocery store, but I'm giving them 3 stars on the strength of Newtons *other* fruit products, the Fig Newtons and the Newtons Fruit Crisps.

When I discovered this gum, I thought I'd give it a try since the concept reminded me of the old Gator Gum from when I was a kid.  This gum has been a lifesaver for me when it comes workout time.  I just pop a piece about the time the trainer says ""3-2-1-Go!"", and it keeps me from having to stop what I'm doing to down some water.  (It really seems to do a better job of keeping my mouth hydrated than that sip of water did anyway.)  All the flavors are acceptable, as well, which is nice.  The only down side I have found is that the flavor doesn't last very long.

After trying it (along with some of my co-workers whom I shared the case with), we've pretty much come to similar conclusions:<br /><br />PROS - taste is ok, similar to other canned/bottled ice teas like Lipton (but not Snapple).  The tea seems to almost be some kind of energy drink (without it explicitly saying it's an energy drink - there is a warning about high caffeine sensitivity/content on the can).  On the other hand, it does NOT contain so much caffeine (like a Red Bull) that your heart will race.  Everyone that tried it said they felt more alert, but without the jittery/edgy feeling of so-called energy drinks, and without the crash a couple of hours later.  Each can only has 10 calories and the ingredients seem relatively innocuous/not a lot of chemicals.  Price per can works out similar to other energy-type drinks (though way more than soda).  Non-Carbonated.<br /><br />CONS--if you don't like Acai berries' taste, you will probably not like this tea - Acai has a somewhat tart aftertaste - the tea itself is also not terribly remarkable (compared to brands like Snapple and Arizona).  The calorie burning claims are pretty hard to verify - maybe the drink is intended to boost your energy before a workout, so you can work out more effectively?  Cans didn't seem too sturdy - one got punctured in transit, and several got dented (probably more of an issue if you have it shipped; not sure if this is available in stores?).<br /><br />Overall, an ok product, so you'll have to weigh the pro's and con's I mentioned.

From my taste test of four brands, including Bissinger's, I found Bissinger's offers a perfect blend between the chocolate coating and the malted interior.  It is difficult for me to rank the quality of each brand, because the chocolate coating of each is unique, and depending on your taste buds or even the time of day, you may prefer one over the other. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with Bissinger's.  That is not the case with two other maltball brands I compared this too.  Another winner in my book is Ghiradelli.

Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

My local stores don't carry such things. I live in a rural community and am approximately 70 miles one way from the nearest natural and organic supermarket. Online shopping makes more sense for my family. Wanting to make a recipe that I had not made in years which called for pudding mix I hopped onto Amazon one afternoon, did a search for ""natural pudding mix"" and behold! Better Bowls came up in the search results!<br /><br />I had not tried this product previously---I usually opt for buying one box of something before committing to a case lot purchase---but I had high hopes that this pudding would meet my family's needs. I have a child who has a red dye intolerance (both red #40 and cochineal/carmine extracts send her skin into fits of eczema). Unfortunately this means that the most famous national branded pudding mixes do not work for us. Like so many other boxed mixes out there today, many puddings use red #40 added as a colorant, which my child cannot have.<br />We were so excited to see that Better Bowls Vanilla Instant Pudding is free from those colorants!<br /><br />I was also pleased to see that the seller, Better Bowls,  was participating with Amazon on the Prime shipping offering...so I clicked, it shipped immediately and I had my pudding mix in two days.<br /><br />This pudding didn't just meet my expectations, but it exceeded them!  Not only did I make up a batch for snacking on after school, but I also used Better Bowls in the recipe that called for boxed pudding mix. I am happy to report that it performed exactly as the small box of national brand pudding normally does for me! I also love the fact that I can make a dish of rich creamy pudding for my family and not have to worry about what I am feeding them. The fact that there's fiber in there too is a plus...not that you can tell by the taste! My kids have no clue about the healthy ingredients in there---they just know that it tastes good.<br />I was so pleased with this purchase that we bought the Better Bowls Instant Pudding and Pie Filling, Chocolate, Heart Healthy, Gluten-free, Good Source of Fiber, Protein and Calcium, Low Fat, Low Sodium, Natural Colors and Flavors, (4.1oz Pouches) Pack of 7 as well. We'll be back for more of both when we run out!"
